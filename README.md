# Projects
Stuff that I am actually proud of.

### ATMOSPHERIC SPECTRAL ANALYSIS:
This was a data analysis project which I did as my L2 Wolfram Multiparadigm Data Science Course (https://www.wolfram.com/wolfram-u/courses/data-science/multiparadigm-data-science/).
The project covers:
 - How to wrangle and clean large datasets.
 - Exploring the general trends in the atmospheric data of exoplanets.
 - Examining what compounds are responsible for the fluctuations in the spectra.
 - Using ML to identify exoplanets based on their atmospheric fingerprint.
 - Extracting tangible quantitative data from atmospheric spectra to predict the habitability of certain exoplanets.

### NATURAL LANGUAGE GENERATION:
This was an idea for a project proposal for a natural language generation (NLG) project.
Inspired by my work for the VR study "Creating immersive training experiences in VR" (https://www.bath.ac.uk/guides/vertically-integrated-projects-current-vips/#creating-immersive-training-experiences-in-virtual-reality).
The project covers:
 - How to research and cite sources.
 - Generating semantically sensible natural language.
 - Creating training data to train language models on.
 - Modifying the GAN framework for NLG.

### PREDICTIVE POLICING REVIEW:
This was my submission for the module "CM50272: Humans and Intelligent Machines". Based off of the book "The Shortcut: Why Intelligent Machines Do Not Think Like Us" by Nello Christiani, the module discusses how humans interact with intelligent systems, how this will affect us as society, and what we can do going forward. In this essay, I discuss my thoughts on predictive policing (a data-driven approach to policing where we use socieoeconomic, historical and social media to predict high-risk individuals and where crime is most likely to occur). I argue that, while such technology is good in the idea, theoretical sense, when applying it practically we encourage a culture of discrimination, fear and an erosing of the very values that law enforcement aims to protect.

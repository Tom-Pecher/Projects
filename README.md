# Projects
Stuff that I am actually proud of.

### ATMOSPHERIC SPECTRAL ANALYSIS:
This was a data analysis project which I did as my L2 Wolfram Multiparadigm Data Science Course.
The project covers:
 - How to wrangle and clean large datasets.
 - Exploring the general trends in the atmospheric data of exoplanets.
 - Examining what compounds are responsible for the fluctuations in the spectra.
 - Using ML to identify exoplanets based on their atmospheric fingerprint.
 - Extracting tangible quantitative data from atmospheric spectra to predict the habitability of certain exoplanets.

### NATURAL LANGUAGE GENERATION:

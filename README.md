# Projects
Stuff that I am actually proud of.

### ATMOSPHERIC SPECTRAL ANALYSIS:
This was a data analysis project which I did as my L2 Wolfram Multiparadigm Data Science Course (https://www.wolfram.com/wolfram-u/courses/data-science/multiparadigm-data-science/).
The project covers:
 - How to wrangle and clean large datasets.
 - Exploring the general trends in the atmospheric data of exoplanets.
 - Examining what compounds are responsible for the fluctuations in the spectra.
 - Using ML to identify exoplanets based on their atmospheric fingerprint.
 - Extracting tangible quantitative data from atmospheric spectra to predict the habitability of certain exoplanets.

### NATURAL LANGUAGE GENERATION:
This was an idea for a project proposal for a natural language generation (NLG) project.
Inspired by my work for the VR study "Creating immersive training experiences in VR" (https://www.bath.ac.uk/guides/vertically-integrated-projects-current-vips/#creating-immersive-training-experiences-in-virtual-reality).
The project covers:
 - How to research and cite sources.
 - Generating semantically sensible natural language.
 - Creating training data to train language models on.
 - Modifying the GAN framework for NLG.
